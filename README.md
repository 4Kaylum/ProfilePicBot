# KikBot
This is Kik bot that is designed to get the profile picture of any user and return it nicely in the chat.

## How to Use
Just mention the bot in your chat! It's username is `@ProfilePicBot`, and you can just ping it with `@ProfilePicBot [username]`, and it'll grab the profile picture for you, no problem.

## Get Your Own
First you need to set up your own Kik bot profile. Head on over to [the Kik dev page](https://dev.kik.com/) to set yours up. From there, you can create a username for your botperson. With that, you also get an API key. You will need that to interface with your bot and the API.

From there, you can clone my project. You'll need to rename `ConfigExample.json` to `Config.json`, but other than that it should work fine. After that you can run the project by using `node _Main.js`.
